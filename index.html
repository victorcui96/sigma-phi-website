				<p class=" black_text">	&emsp;&emsp;Sigma Phi at UNC is a safe, motivating, and supportive space that helped me pursue my own passion. I joined during my first year at Carolina because I saw a real community of diverse people with diverse interests, all driven by excellence. Pledging, for me, was a challenge, not of the hazing variety since we have a strict no hazing policy, but of a deeply personal journey that eventually bound me forever tightly with Sigma Phi and my brothers. I can safely say that joining Sigma Phi was, hands down, the greatest decision I made in college.
				<br>
				&emsp;&emsp;Our amazing brothers not only consistently have one of the highest GPAs in the Greek community (#1 last year), we also continue to be staunch proponents of sexual assault awareness and prevention. Each year, we host the annual Walk a Mile event, which last year brought together (for the first time) representatives from the entire Greek community and beyond to engage in this difficult but necessary dialogue, while also raising over $2,000 for the Orange County Rape Crisis Center. We pride ourselves on being socioeconomically diverse, with dues less than $500 per semester and scholarships for those that need them.
				<br>
				&emsp;&emsp;I love my brothers with all my heart. Perhaps, you will too.</p>
